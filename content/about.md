## `$ whoami`
My name is John Wu, a highschooler interested in most technologies.
This blog is just for me to rant and take notes for random stuff I'm doing. Currently, I play CTFs, selfhost servers, and play table tennis. This blog itself is selfhosted with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

An unfiltered look into the demented mind of a nerd.

DISCLAIMER: Anything I write as fact should not be taken as fact, it is just the understanding of a low GPA highschool student. For example, "the Linux kernel has a scheduler for CPU tasks" should not be taken as fact as I found that from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0uNh_lbtSs).

Practice experience new interesting stuff.
