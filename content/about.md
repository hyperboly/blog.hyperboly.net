## `$ whoami`
My name is John Wu, a highschooler interested in most technologies.
This blog is where I host my notes, writeups, and some extra stuff.
This blog itself is selfhosted with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

DISCLAIMER: Anything I write as fact should not be taken as fact, it is just the understanding of a low GPA highschool student.
For example, "the Linux kernel has a scheduler for CPU tasks" should not be taken as fact as I found that from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0uNh_lbtSs).

Practice experience new interesting stuff.
