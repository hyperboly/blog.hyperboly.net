My last neovim article was from 2024 and I've finally taken the time to rewrite the atrocity that was the neovim unwrapped version I had in 2024.

# What's Different
- [Link to repo](https://github.com/hyperboly/nixCats-nvim)
- Using NixCats this time because I can understand nix a bit better
- Not many changes other than more plugins from kickstart.nvim.

# NixCats
Using NixCats is quite simple if you have worked with other nix projects before.
