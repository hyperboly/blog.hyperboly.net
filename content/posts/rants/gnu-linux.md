This will be a short note on my thoughts of whether to say "GNU plus Linux" or just "Linux."
I like Richard Stallman and all his work in the free software community and I definitely like it more than Linus' position on "open source."
For whether to say Linux or GNU+Linux though, I'm sticking with Linux.

1. Linux is easier to say
2. Linux is much more recognized
3. Everyone who believes in free software knows it's GNU+Linux
4. Even if you call it GNU+Linux, people who don't believe in free software yet use it won't get the political message anyways
5. GNU deserves credit and the `man` pages all include GNU in the footers
6. I'm sorry GNU

I get it Mr. Stallman, if I didn't get any credit for my work I would be mad as well.
There are so many in the same position though, no one recognizes the great work `curl`'s creator Daniel Stenberg even though he has created and maintained so many essential programs.

I'm sorry GNU and FSF enthusiasts.
