The internet is exposing younger and younger people to more and more mature things.
Are we accelerating the flow of information to younger generations?

## Definitions
I don't mean maturity in the "he's so mature" kind of way.
I mean mature as in mature content, content for adults that aren't meant for kids.
This content/information can include advice, pornography, or others.
I consider 18 and under people to be kids, it includes me.

## What's Going on Right Now?
There's too much information on the internet that isn't geared towards 18 year olds and under.
Before the internet, kids would be not be able to get so much information unless they went to the library.
Some categories that I think is ruining generational ideologies: politics, money, marketing.

### Politics
I went down a pretty bad rabbithole a few years ago in the "alt-right" sphere of things.
I don't think it's that bad if you are a rational person, some trends are good, some are bad.
Going down the right wing camp makes you kind of less sensitive to jokes on political ideologies such as gender or race.
I quit going down that rabbithole because of the hypocrisy that exists in politics.
The only thing I would hear online is how bad the left are because look at the blue haired liberals (they are not true liberals).
On the left wing side of the internet, they would say look how bad the right is because of these gun owners.
Both sides are the same thing, they don't care about their core ideologies, just how to get votes for the US elections.

Politics is a common route that kids go down on the internet.
Because I have been in the MUN and debate scene for a while, I know a lot of political kids.
Some have tried to start their own movements, regardless of how irrational and stupid their implementation was.

Some are still trying to start their own movements, for example [project fed](https://www.instagram.com/project_fed/), which is the dumbest thing I saw yesterday.
Project FED is a project highschoolers from Northern Taiwan are starting to increase awareness on poor education in Taiwan.
Good sentiment, terrible idea/implementation.
Their plan, instead of directly helping kids, is to go and spread awareness online.
How will they do this?
- research
- create a documentary
- create an interview through podcasting
- use web3 technology to spread more awareness
- other ways to spread awareness

Okay, this sounds great, except then you remember these are highschoolers.
1. I have organized my own event before (NIFTy, go join it for a good forensics tournament), and by God my organizational skills are terrible.
Without any adult supervision, much of the paperwork and required stuff for the event wouldn't have been done.
There was very little groundwork for the event so a lot of it was either taken from years before or created from scratch.
On top of that, I had school work to do, hobbies to care about, and little motivation to do the boring paperwork.

2. I highly doubt they will create a good amateur level documentary, even though the bar for amateur film is already pretty low.
Even if they do, I doubt that having the language as English will be able to spread any awareness in Taiwan.

3. Interviewing and podcasting is a good idea, if they have the personalities for it.
I doubt people are going to be listening to a group of highschoolers with poor to mid level English talking about rural education in Taiwan.
No Taiwanese person would listen to it, no foreigner in Taiwan would listen to it, and unless they have some kind of miracle personality, even their friends wouldn't listen for more than an episode.
This is where a guest would be very helpful but also where that language barrier fails them again.

4. Web3 technology. For most people I talk to, they don't need to know why this is a terrible idea.
The implementation they have decided on is [DAO](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/), or Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
I myself only know about it because of project FED, but crypto is a very simple concept.
DAO is basically decentralized ownership of an organization through a pay to win model.
This is like people with more stock ownership in a company get more influence over the organization, and those with less get less power.
The people not financially invested will not have any power in the organization.
As DAO is an implementation and not a technology, what is the actual technology that's going to be used???
They claim they want to use web3, yet I don't see that as a possibility or even rational with the cause they are supporting.
Another thing with marketing your political ideologies with web3 technology is that people will automatically assume you are a scam, even though I know these highschoolers aren't looking to scam anyone, probably.

These issues stem from the reason that they are STILL KIDS.
They do not have the experience of starting any political movement and the only ones they've truly seen are ones online.
Slacktivism has grown a generation of more slacktivists.
This all goes back to the original point.
Because these highschoolers have been exposed to political things online all their life, they believe they have the power to change something.
That's why projects like FED are started.
Real activist movements like Martin Luther King's movement are started by real adults though.
These are not things you can do on a whim because you feel bad for rural education, these are real issues that require adults to plan out.
Just because the movement is by highschoolers, we can't support something that doesn't add on to the real cause just because it's cute.

### Money
The concept of cost in the real world is a very simple thing to understand.
A wad of cash means you're rich and a few coins means you must start rationing.
Digital money is where the concept of money starts to appear like an abstraction instead of something real.
Physically being able to see exactly how much money you have is very different to looking at a number on the screen.
Most of the time people don't even look at their screen because they just swipe and go.

The largest problem with newer generations is that the internet exposes them to rich people.
I'm not even talking about get rich quick gurus.
I'm saying all the highschool kids in the US that are just trust fund kids.
They often flaunt on the internet all their stuff.
This isn't flexing, or at least I don't think it's self aware, it's just kids showing off their little accessories.
I think that this warps what others see as reality because some of these accessories are extremely expensive.
This is essentially the boomer argument for why the internet is bad, but it's rooted in a very real financial reason.
Some parents can't afford these things even when their kids are seeing expensive stuff online all the time.
Some parents don't want to participate in stupid fads that last for a month because it's a waste of money.
Even middle class kids have a warped mind on the value of money where before it would only be trust fund kids.

Last thing is on the topic of a bubbled tech economy.
AI, servers (cloud), and crypto have a bubbled economy.
This is why Amazon, Facebook, Twitter are letting go so many employees.
Big Tech is failing, losing lots of money, and looking for more ways to monetize.
The cloud space is already crumbling (look at Docker).
Most of crypto has already fallen, except for Monero because it's based.
The problem is that people made real money from Shitcoins.
People on social media sell shitcoins to others by flexing how much money they have.
The main issue I have with this apart from the scams is that highschoolers see this.
Highschoolers and young kids see this and think that they are also participants in this.
That's where you get kids on social media saying "I'm broke."
**Of course you're broke you're a kid**.
Very few people expect you to have a lot of money.
The concept of being broke isn't even for kids in the first place, it's for bum college students and adults.

Money has become warped by the internet and I think that's pretty dogwater.

## Is It a Bad Thing?
Is accelerated maturity a bad thing?
Yes, but sometimes not.

I've already explained why the money part is almost always a bad thing for kids, but the politics is a little different.
Sure, I don't like having kids root for things they don't understand or truly care about, but it is a good experience.
I think that my time in the right wing rabbithole was good for me because one I got out, I had experience in distancing myself from what I'm into and see if it's really rational.
The downside is that people who don't do this will forever be stuck in the political stuff and not be able to try to understand what the other side is saying.
My solution was to tune it all out and go against both sides rather than compromise, but that's just because I'm a stupid contrarian.
I think that the internet will force normal people to have to adapt and parent much stricter than before.

## Effective Parenting
Disabling access to the internet is not effective because kids will inevitably be exposed to the internet and it's mature content (not just porn, also politics and stuff).
This is why I propose what has been done for thousands of years yet have been lost because of the internet.
Educating your child after exposure to the internet.
A novel idea.
Educate your kids that TikTok will rot their brains, Instagram will steal all their information and ruin their life, and not talking too much on the internet as to not incriminate themselves.
A lot of this knowledge I had to learn through experiencing it first hand or go down large rabbitholes to truly grasp the dangers of the internet, but I think the new generation of internet raised parents need to teach their kids about this.

The last thing is limiting access to the internet.
Way too many things rot people's minds right now.
After the death of television, a lot of kids shows are on YouTube and from Elsagate we know not to trust YouTube with kids.
I think even though you can set up your own DNS, extensions, and everything else, the best thing to do is supervision.
Give your kids internet freedom but under parental supervision.
Don't let your 12 year old and under kids unrestricted access to YouTube, or even YouTube Kids.
But unless they are watching something truly terrible, let your kids do what they want on the internet.
Let them watch boring Minecraft Letsplays, 12 seasons of Teletubbies, or whatever entertainment there is that isn't going to rot your kids brains.
