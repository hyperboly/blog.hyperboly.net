Running down the history of Model United Nations (MUN) from 5 years ago today, and what it has evolved into in Taiwan. There has to be a stop to this.

## My Qualifications
I'm just a nobody that started MUN in 7th grade.
I primarily do debate and MUN.
In debate, I have done every format I know of in the competitive scene (of which I only like AP, BP, and LD):
- Asian parliamentary (AP)
- British parliamentary (BP)
- Policy
- Public Forum (PF)
- Lincoln Douglas (LD)

I was in the international scene for MUN when I started, but have since moved to the local scene.
So started from STMUN -> TainanMUN.

## The Prologue
When I started MUN, there were only a few that really stood out.
- TainanMUN: really the largest local MUN at the time.
- STMUN: close to where I live, so it mattered. Also a large international MUN.
- HSINMUN: has since deteriorated to nothing, but is approved by THIMUN. Also international
- TASMUN: for the ultra rich, the people with the big bags. Also international

International MUNs here just mean that international schools go (TAS, KAS, IBSH...).
MUNs at the time had a level of prestige (not that it ever had a lot).
Maybe I was too young at the time and just remember things from childhood as good (like old people), but I think this point stands.
There were around 4 MUNs per year and when you went, it felt much more "prestigious" because of the low quantity/high demand.

Our school used to co-host STMUN, until KAS committed a hostile takeover with I-Shou against Dr. Fruit.
Doctor was just too good for them.
I do believe that it was either Dr. Fruit or Ms. Bigley that started the whole MUN stuff in Taiwan, maybe it wasn't.
It is believable though because we did start the english debate scene in Taiwan.

## The Status Quo
### First Problem
> Status Quo: the existing state of affairs ([Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/status%20quo))

I'm so smart I can use big words and sound like I know what I'm doing!!!
This train of thought is how I imagine MUN people to think.
Not just MUN people, but debaters too.
How do I know? Because I think this too.
I don't care how much people deny it, when you have too many syllables in every 2 words you say, you are acting smart.
Local school participation in international MUNs are low because of this high entry language barriers.

### Second Problem
I don't know how it started, but local schools had a demand for MUNs.
Maybe the appeal of politics started it? Or an admiration of speaking English fast while saying nothing.
But it did. The local schools were interested in MUNs.
This in itself is not a huge problem, the problem is how they started to participate in it.
If you can't understand international MUNs, you just start your own. Right?
So they started MUNs.

Schools no one has ever heard of started them:
- Tainan Second Senior High
- Ming Dao
- Dao Ming
- 竹風
- 竹北
- 雲林
- Look for them and you'll find the smallest, most obscure ones

So obviously there is high demand.
With so many MUNs, there obviously comes a problem.

#### Stretching Out Your Audience
This issue relates to both delegates and organizers.
For organizers, this means that you will only have one to two committees for your event, which is not good for trying to become a big/popular MUN.
For delegates, this means you will pay to go to MUNs that have very little recognition and very low quantity of people. We're not even talking about debate quality (of course, MUN debate quality has never been good).
Good MUN debaters are rare, and with so many options for MUNs, you are stretching out where they will go.
Some may stick with tradition and go to STMUN, or try a new one like Ming Dao.
The quantity of MUNs has created competition for delegates by organizers and created a worse environment for delegates.

#### MUNers
I don't call people who participate in 2-3 MUNs per year "MUNers," but those who do it as a full time job definitely qualify.
These are people who have nothing outside of their highschool life other than MUN.
The people who decorate their social media with MUN only.
They breathe MUN.
This is a terrible thing to do to kids.

I've always hated the aspect of debate politicizing highschoolers, because there is no rational thought when reading something political.
Especially when algorithms on Youtube, Instagram, and TikTok (please don't use TikTok please don't do it) will know you like politics and see what ticks you off.
If you like left leaning ideas, they will show you right leaning ideas because it increases your engagement with their websites.
When highschoolers get into politics, they do not learn the basics.
The history, the concepts, and the economic value of each.
Many delve too deep into one side and become enveloped in the internet echo chamber.
I would know, I went into alt-right rabbitholes before (still lurk on 4chan).
Exposing highschoolers to so many topics like in debate is terrible because it either desensitizes them to politics or radicalizes them.
I like radicalization, but not when it stems from reading into a topic they don't understand.
I enjoy communists, nationalists, and capitalists because I admire how much they care.
But people who don't care and only read the headlines, the pros of one party, and pretend they know stuff; unbelievable.
Many people use radical leftists as an example, they call them "liberals" and "democrats."
It's insane to think that the people referred to as liberals today follow no liberal values.
This is how the internet has created people that don't understand the words they use but can influence elections.
MUN should provide educational value, but the quantity of them has begun to make people believe in causes they don't understand.
MUNers are wrapped into these ideologies and debate them in MUN, creating more ~~zombies~~ MUNers.

This is just a rationalization for me justifying my hatred for MUNers.
I truly just find all the people doing excessive amounts of MUN to be cringe.
They post it on social media, talk about it all the time, and participate in way too many.
Is this really the only hobby you have?

MUNers are sad creatures. But hey, I'm a highschooler too, so why listen to me?

#### The Bubble We Live In
The other problem this new quantity creates is the bubble that we live in now.
There are way too many conferences at a time MUN is dying in many parts of Taiwanese schools.
The demand is just too low for more MUNs right now.
Because of university applications (and people trying to get real value from MUN), everyone in Taiwan participating in MUNs are trying to get into a chair position, an organizer position, or an officer position.
This creates a bubble in MUNs, where the quality of the MUN no longer matters, because the organizers will still go through with organizing even if there's a low quantity of delegates.
MUN in Taiwan has become less of an event and more of a product.
The value in MUNs and their names are now gone because if you can host your own you get a good record on your university application.

## The Epilogue
People need to start realizing some truths:
1. The first thing people need to realize is that there is no value in going to MUNs.
MUNs do not provide an economic benefit or a benefit to your CV.
People don't care about you being a delegate in a random conference, they care about you winning events (I think).
MUN is something to do for the education and experience, not for your future.

2. The second thing people need to realize is there are way too many MUNs right now.
While choice is important, we shouldn't be stretching out talent to different obscure MUNs, but gathering them so newcomers will have a better experience.
Not every MUN club in the country needs to host their own MUNs.

So with all these problems, what should happen?
One thing I can see needing to happen is decreasing the amount of MUNs, this will just be a natural selection process where many MUNs will start disappearing.
The other is restructuring how MUNs are hosted.
There has been a constant decrease in MUN quality every year.
HSINMUN used to be okay, but now the organization has become terrible.
The main problem is in organizers choosing their friends to organize MUNs.
The other problem is the lack of teacher supervision.
Modern HSINMUN and STMUN are obvious products of students hosting an event.
Many people don't see this as a problem because there are so many delegates attending, they get a pass.
The delegates are only there because they are famous for their quality when teachers ran the MUN, but now their quality has dipped to negative.

Restructure your leadership please.

## It's an Easy Event, Try Debate
MUN is easy.
There's no real competition; if you want real competition, try real debate.
Of course, MUNers will never do this because they no longer are here for the educational value, but for educat**ing** others.

Why should you try debate instead of MUN?
The educational value is much higher even if you don't win anything.
Debate teaches you many things that MUN tries to emulate:
- Fast thinking:
    - MUN's point of informations attempt to make you think fast on the spot by having questions you don't expect get asked
    - MUN failed because you can just deny all questions
    - Asian parliamentary debate gives you 30 minutes to prep a 30 minute debate
    - British parliamentary debate gives you 15 minutes to prep a nearly 45 minute debate
    - Debate succeeds because of the faster paced preparations and drawn out debates
- Preparation:
    - MUN uses your resolution and position paper to try to give educational value
    - MUN position papers fail because they are often 3 page long, often times following wikipedia
    - Policy debate gives you several months in preparation for a series of 1 hour 30 minute debates
    - Policy requires evidence (not from wikipedia) for **every** point you make
    - Debate succeeds because it requires extensive research into one topic
- Making Speeches:
    - MUN does not force delegates to speak, but encourages participation in debate
    - MUN fails the hardest here because almost no one is willing to talk in a local event
    - Every debate format forces you to talk

The only point that debate would lose on is teaching teamwork.
In MUN, you are forced to bloc with strangers and somehow create a draft resolution.
In debate, you often get to choose your partners (unless you're a loser national team member)

There are many problems in debate too, in fact I hate it almost as much as I hate MUN, but it is the better alternative if you want to continue a life in speech events.

# The Only Event You Need
Now that I have trashed every event out there, it's time to shill my own.
Every year at IBST, we host a speech event called Nanke Invitational Forensics Tournament (NIFTy).
This event includes these events each year:
- Debate:
    - Policy debate
    - Lincoln Douglass debate (2023 only, may not be true in future years)
- Forensics
    - Impromptu
    - Story telling
    - Editorial commentary
    - Dual interpretation
    - Solo interpretation

Visit [our website for 2023](https://ibstnifty.github.io/speechInfo.html) for more information.
You can also directly contact me for information on next year.

We continued NIFTy this year because we are trying to create an actually GOOD English speech event in Taiwan.
The **only** other US speech event in Taiwan is NSDA, which is a rigged mess.
Coaches from NSDA are paid based on how much their students win, and so obviously they will try and rig the judges.
The only participants who win and participate are from trained by NSDA.
Please join NIFTy to support a fair speech event.

Tough read, way too long for what I'm used to.
