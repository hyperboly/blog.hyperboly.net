I'm writing this because I have experience talking about religion with Christian fanatics, athiests, and super athiests.

## Qualification
Am I qualified to talk about religion?
No. No one is qualified to talk about religion.
These are my thoughts on religion as of 2023 as a 16 year old.
I was born in a Christian family but right now I'm not Christian.
A lot of my ideas are influenced by Luke Smith, although I do not follow what he says.
Luke Smith makes many points I agree with and is able to articulate them in words.

## My Take on Religion
I think that religion is necessary.
Even though I don't believe in it, I think it's necessary for those who don't.
Religion is a good thing for many people because it's something people can believe in.
The time that I was born into creates a lot of doubt in belief and I think religion is something people can still hold on to.
I am not a Christian because I think I don't deserve that name, I do a ton of stuff that a true believer wouldn't.
I believe in Christ, God, and all that; I just don't think I fit the criteria of being a Christian.
What is that criteria? I guess it's the qualification of being forgiven by God.
I don't think I deserve forgiveness from God, I've done/said too much sinful stuff.

I think you can believe in the individual while worshipping God.
Many in our society today blame their environment, upbringing, and other stuff to point out why God doesn't exist, is a terrible thing, or why their life sucks.
I think that if your life sucks, that's both your environment and **yourself**.
It is not fully the environment's fault that your life sucks.
There are obvious exceptions to this, but for most well off middle class people I do think that they have the power to control things.
I don't like Jordan Peterson but his point on focusing on your own life instead of caring about things that older, wiser people deal with is correct.
We should be trying to improve our lives by cleaning, learning, and doing other stuff instead of being afraid of larger problems like world hunger or climate change.
Basically just try to become better and then you can start caring about the larger issues.

In the case that your life sucks because of your environment, you can attribute more than half to the environment.
That also means you still have control over your life and should improve it though.
It does not mean that you should give up trying to improve and just going along with having a sucky life.
For the people that don't give up and try to improve, good job.

Complaining is a very natural thing for humans to do, but I think you have still do your job even if you complain.
I can complain about homework all I want, but it's still work I have to do (very small problem but principle applies).

I do think that if you life sucks because of your environment, religion gives you the hope, the light to keep on going.
Just knowing that your life will improve if you work on yourself is not enough motivation, humans (probably) tend to want to believe that a higher power will help and guide them to a better life.
Religion provides this very well, especially because it brings you principles that is universally good (10 commandments).

## Take on Super Athiests
I don't like super athiests because they are too rational.
Most athiests think "well if God dropped us in here then why would he let us sin and then punish us?"
That works rationally, but you have to think about the function of religion.
Religion keeps people under control, if we had no values that religion gives us then we would be in Mad Max.
Think about 90% of code of ethics or whatever they're called.
They all are tied to some religious ideology.
Can you have morals even if you're not religious? Yes of course.
However, these ethics are not standardized and known.
Disputes between different people arises over which ethic is more just, which creates division and then the same problem athiests have with religion continues.

Another thing with athiests is they do not like religious people because the second they see a religious person, athiests deem them irrational.
I have had personal contact with this mentality and it's pretty funny.
Most super athiests I have met do not have any firm belief in anything.
They may have superficial beliefs in politics, but nothing they would truly change their lives or die for.
The lack of apathy in these super athiests normally leads to them having much looser ethics than a religious person would.
Athiests point to the organized Church doing stupid and terrible stuff, yet they are no better.

## Take on Christian Fanatics
So let's talk about the organized Church doing terrible stuff that can't be defended by any sane person.
The Church has diddled kids, started wars, and massacred millions (number is not accurate).
No one can defend these actions except for Christian fanatics.
Most Christians deny it happened, defend it with the Bible out of context, or say they are different.
The only rational answer would be that the new Christians are different from the ones that would diddle kids or kill.
That is also what I believe in.

I like Christianity, but I hate organized religion.
The power structure that organized religion creates is the most human thing I've ever seen.
Although I do not understand God, I don't think that a difference in power between man would be something God approves, yet that is what Churches have created.
The priest is on top, the leaders below, and the worshippers on the bottom.
The worshippers listen to the priest unconditionally sometimes and believe in what the priest says, even though the priest is only a man.
I think the most effective way to worship is by reading the source material then discussing it.
This is the model of the early churches.

Before the organized Church by the Romans and English, religion was much more communal, there was no central figure telling others what the scripture means.
The way it worked is a little bit like the free software development process.
People join in some group (church), they ask questions about the scripture, and someone expresses their opinion on it.
The main part is that these people still put their own interpretation of worship into God, not blindly follow another human's words.
Why would you listen to a "studied priest" on what the Bible means when it is just an interpretation by humans instead of God himself?
Read the Bible, follow basic human common sense and principles, and interpret the words for yourself.
You can ask others when you are stuck, just like the stories of disciples helping others in the Bible, but the people helping should not have power over the learners.
It is merely a worshipper discussing the Bible with another worshipper, not a subordinate questioning a master.

Organized Church is bad, individual/communal worship is good.

## We Killed God
The famous paragraph "God is Dead" by Friedrich Nietzsche is too true in my age.
Here is the quote:

> "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"

This quote to me means that God is a concept, not a tangible being.
This should be pretty obvious, especially to athiests.
God being a concept should also be true in Christianity though, the only tangible version of God humans have seen is Jesus.
So by us not believing in God, we have killed God, which leads to a loss of direction in ethics.
Just like I said before, people who don't believe in God have a much looser sense of ethics than those who do.
By society not believing God, society will lose a direction of morality, is murder a crime anymore if God is not here to oversee it?

If God is just a concept and we have forgotten or stopped believing in him, then we have killed him.

As I've said, religion brings hope and motivation to people who need it, and so killing off God is a negative outcome for all of us.
Athiests who believe that people worshipping God are all irrational needs to recognize the necessity of God, and those who worship the Church instead of God needs to recognize the hypocrisy of the concept.

That's just my view as a 16 year old though, maybe I'll change when I grow up.
Right now though, this is the best rationalization of religion I can think of.
