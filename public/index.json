[{"content":"Running down the history of Model United Nations (MUN) from 5 years ago today, and what it has evolved into in Taiwan. There has to be a stop to this.\nMy Qualifications I\u0026rsquo;m just a nobody that started MUN in 7th grade. I primarily do debate and MUN. In debate, I have done every format I know of in the competitive scene (of which I only like AP, BP, and LD):\n Asian parliamentary (AP) British parliamentary (BP) Policy Public Forum (PF) Lincoln Douglas (LD)  I was in the international scene for MUN when I started, but have since moved to the local scene. So started from STMUN -\u0026gt; TainanMUN.\nThe Prologue When I started MUN, there were only a few that really stood out.\n TainanMUN: really the largest local MUN at the time. STMUN: close to where I live, so it mattered. Also a large international MUN. HSINMUN: has since deteriorated to nothing, but is approved by THIMUN. Also international TASMUN: for the ultra rich, the people with the big bags. Also international  International MUNs here just mean that international schools go (TAS, KAS, IBSH\u0026hellip;). MUNs at the time had a level of prestige (not that it ever had any). Maybe I was too young at the time and just remember things from childhood as good (like old people), but I think this point stands. There were around 4 MUNs per year and when you went, it felt much more \u0026ldquo;prestigious\u0026rdquo; because of the low quantity/high demand\nOur school used to co-host STMUN, until KAS committed a hostile takeover with I-Shou against Dr. Fruit. Doctor was just too good for them. I do believe that it was either Dr. Fruit or Ms. Bigley that started the MUN, maybe it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. It is believable though because we did start the english debate scene in Taiwan.\nThe Status Quo First Problem  Status Quo: the existing state of affairs (Merriam Webster)\n I\u0026rsquo;m so smart I can use big words and sound like I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing!!! This train of thought is how I imagine MUN people to think. Not just MUN people, but debaters too. How do I know? Because I think this too. I don\u0026rsquo;t care how much people deny it, when you speak with high syllable count words, you are acting smart. Local school participation in international MUNs are low because of this high entry due to language barriers.\nSecond Problem I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it started, but local schools had a demand for MUNs. Maybe the appeal of politics started it? Or an admiration of speaking English fast while saying nothing. But it did. The local schools were interested in MUNs. This in itself is not a huge problem, the problem is how they started to participate in it. If you can\u0026rsquo;t understand international MUNs, you just start your own. Right? So they started MUNs.\nSchools no one has ever heard of started them:\n Tainan Second Senior High Ming Dao Dao Ming 竹風 竹北 雲林 Look for them and you\u0026rsquo;ll find the smallest, most obscure ones  So obviously there is high demand. With so many MUNs, there obviously comes a problem.\nStretching Out Your Audience This issue relates for both delegates and organizers. For organizers, this means that you will only have one to two committees for your event, which is not good for trying to become big as an MUN. For delegates, this means you will pay to go to MUNs that have very little recognition and very low quantity of people. We\u0026rsquo;re not even talking about debate quality (of course, MUN debate quality has never been good). Good MUN debaters are rare, and with so many options for MUNs, you are stretching out where they will go. Some may stick with tradition and go to STMUN, or try a new one like Ming Dao. The quantity of MUNs has created competition for delegates by organizers and created a worse environment for delegates.\nMUNers I don\u0026rsquo;t call people who participate in 2-3 MUNs per year \u0026ldquo;MUNers,\u0026rdquo; but those who do it as a full time job definitely qualify. These are people who have nothing outside of their highschool life other than MUN. The people who decorate their social media with MUN only. They breathe MUN. This is a terrible thing to do to kids.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always hated the aspect of debate politicizing highschoolers, because there is no rational thought when reading something political. Especially when algorithms on Youtube, Instagram, and TikTok (please don\u0026rsquo;t use TikTok please don\u0026rsquo;t do it) will know you like politics and see what ticks you off. If you like left leaning ideas, they will show you right leaning ideas because it increases your engagement with their websites. When highschoolers get into politics, they do not learn the basics. The history, the concepts, and the economic value of each. Many delve too deep into one side and become enveloped in the internet echo chamber. I would know, I went into alt-right rabbitholes before (still lurk on 4chan). Exposing highschoolers to so many topics like in debate is terrible because it either desensitizes them to politics or radicalizes them. I like radicalization, but not when it stems from reading into a topic they don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I enjoy communists, nationalists, and capitalists because I admire how much they care. But people who don\u0026rsquo;t care and only read the headlines, the pros of one party, and pretend they know stuff; unbelievable. Many people use radical leftists as an example, they call them \u0026ldquo;liberals\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;democrats.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s insane to think that the people referred to as liberals today follow no liberal values. This is how the internet has created people that don\u0026rsquo;t understand the words they use but can influence elections. MUN should provide educational value, but the quantity of them has begun to make people believe in causes they don\u0026rsquo;t understand. MUNers are wrapped into these ideologies and debate them in MUN, creating more zombies MUNers.\nThis is just a rationalization for me justifying my hatred for MUNers. I truly just find all the people doing excessive amounts of MUN to be cringe. They post it on social media, talk about it all the time, and participate in way too many. Is this really the only hobby you have?\nMUNers are sad creatures. But hey, I\u0026rsquo;m a highschooler too, so why listen to me?\nThe Bubble We Live In The other problem this new quantity creates is the bubble that we live in now. There are way too many conferences at a time MUN is dying in many parts of Taiwanese schools. The demand is just too low for more MUNs right now. Because of university applications (and people trying to get real value from MUN), everyone in Taiwan participating in MUNs are trying to get into a chair position, an organizer position, or an officer position. This creates a bubble in MUNs, where the quality of the MUN no longer matters, because the organizers will still go through with organizing even if there\u0026rsquo;s a low quantity of delegates. MUN in Taiwan has become less of an event and more of a product. The value in MUNs and their names are now gone because if you can host your own you get a good record on your university application.\nThe Epilogue People need to start realizing some truths:\n  The first thing people need to realize is that there is no value in going to MUNs. MUNs do not provide an economic benefit or a benefit to your CV. People don\u0026rsquo;t care about you being a delegate in a random conference, they care about you winning events (I think). MUN is something to do for the education and experience, not for your future.\n  The second thing people need to realize is there are way too many MUNs right now. While choice is important, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be stretching out talent to different obscure MUNs, but gathering them so newcomers will have a better experience. Not every MUN club in the country needs to host their own MUNs.\n  So with all these problems, what should happen? One thing I can see needing to happen is decreasing the amount of MUNs, this will just be a natural selection process where many MUNs will start disappearing. The other is restructuring how MUNs are hosted. There has been a constant decrease in MUN quality every year. HSINMUN used to be okay, but now the organization has become terrible. The main problem is in organizers choosing their friends to do organize. The other problem is the lack of teacher supervision. Modern HSINMUN and STMUN are obvious products of students hosting an event. The problem is that there are so many people attending, they get a pass.\nRestructure your leadership please.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an Easy Event, Try Debate MUN is easy. There\u0026rsquo;s no real competition; if you want real competition, try real debate. Of course, MUNers will never do this because they no longer are here for the educational value, but for educating others.\nWhy should you try debate instead of MUN? The educational value is much higher even if you don\u0026rsquo;t win anything. Debate teaches you many things that MUN tries to emulate:\n Fast thinking:  MUN\u0026rsquo;s point of informations attempt to make you think fast on the spot by having questions you don\u0026rsquo;t expect get asked MUN failed because you can just deny all questions Asian parliamentary debate gives you 30 minutes to prep a 30 minute debate British parliamentary debate gives you 15 minutes to prep a nearly 45 minute debate Debate succeeds because of the faster paced preparations and drawn out debates   Preparation:  MUN uses your resolution and position paper to try to give educational value MUN position papers fail because they are often 3 page long, often times following wikipedia Policy debate gives you several months in preparation for a series of 1 hour 30 minute debates Policy requires evidence (not from wikipedia) for every point you make Debate succeeds because it requires extensive research into one topic   Making Speeches:  MUN does not force delegates to speak, but encourages participation in debate MUN fails the hardest here because almost no one is willing to talk in a local event Every debate format forces you to talk    The only point that debate would lose on is teaching teamwork. In MUN, you are forced to bloc with strangers and somehow create a draft resolution. In debate, you often get to choose your partners (unless you\u0026rsquo;re a loser national team member)\nThere are many problems in debate too, in fact I hate it almost as much as I hate MUN, but it is the better alternative if you want to continue a life in speech events.\nThe Only Event You Need Now that I have trashed every event out there, it\u0026rsquo;s time to shill my own. Every year at IBST, we host a speech event called Nanke Invitational Forensics Tournament (NIFTy). This event includes these events each year:\n Debate:  Policy debate Lincoln Douglass debate (2023 only, may not be true in future years)   Forensics  Impromptu Story telling Editorial commentary Dual interpretation Solo interpretation    Visit our website for 2023 for more information. You can also directly contact me for information on next year.\nWe continued NIFTy this year because we are trying to create an actually GOOD English speech event in Taiwan. The only other US speech event in Taiwan is NSDA, which is a rigged mess. Coaches from NSDA are paid based on how much their students win, and so obviously they will try and rig the judges. The only participants who win and participate are from trained by NSDA. Please join NIFTy to support a fair speech event.\nTough read, way too long for what I\u0026rsquo;m used to.\n","permalink":"https://blog.hyperboly.net/posts/rants/state-of-mun-in-taiwan/","summary":"The bubble of MUN we live in.","title":"State of MUN in Taiwan"},{"content":"I got tired of Spotify stealing my information, showing me ads, and draining my mobile data usage. So I downloaded free music from Youtube.\nTools Downloading Music yt-dlp:\n A fork of youtube-dl, but uses aria2 and bypasses a lot of DRM, and is generally better I think Will be used for downloading songs, playlists\u0026hellip;  Syncing Music syncthing:\n One of the greatest tool for syncthing files, not just music Easy webUI, configuration, and usage Very similar to rsync except it doesn\u0026rsquo;t use ssh and is more \u0026ldquo;user friendly\u0026rdquo; if you don\u0026rsquo;t like CLI  yt-dlp Manual Usage You can manually download videos/audio from Youtube just with yt-dlp alone. The most basic usage is yt-dlp \u0026quot;https://youtube.com/watch?=v...\u0026quot;, which will download the video and audio in the default formats and quality.\nThis is not what you\u0026rsquo;re here for though, you want to know how to use this tool like an ultra chad music listener, so here is the command:\nyt-dlp -x --audio-format opus --add-metadata --metadata-from-title \u0026#34;%(title)s\u0026#34; -o \u0026#34;%(title)s.%(ext)s\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBVTuiShXIE7sDtTKaW4CygVLUEv7zNv2\u0026#34; It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not pretty, so let\u0026rsquo;s go through each argument (also see man yt-dlp)\n yt-dlp: the tool we\u0026rsquo;re using, argument for stdin -x: specifying we want to extract audio --audio-format opus: defines what kind of audio format we want. I am using *.opus here even though it\u0026rsquo;s not the best quality. To get the best quality, replace -x --audio-format opus with -f bestaudio --add-metadata: specifying we want to have metadata like date published, album\u0026hellip; --metadata-from-title \u0026quot;%(title)s\u0026quot;: specifies that we want to extract the metadata from the title, not somewhere else (like when I accessed the video). %(title)s ist just saying have the download file have metadata from the video -o \u0026quot;%(title)s.%(ext)s\u0026quot;: specifying output file name. Or, what the download file name will be called. In this case, the title string with the file extension (specified as opus from -x --audio-format) The youtube link is my own playlist, you can replace it with your own. Just make sure it\u0026rsquo;s in quotes \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;.  My Script The manual way definitely works, but it\u0026rsquo;s slow; plus, you have to redownload your playlist again if you want to add more songs to your playlist. Introducing my script ytpl-update, found here. This script only works on linux, but you can probably use wsl2 and it will work. The script checks if you have yt-dlp installed to the latest version, asks for where you want to download the music, and asks for your music playlist link before downloading the playlist. When you use this script, it creates a file that keeps track of only songs that were explicitly downloaded, and will check the file to know if a song needs to be updated. So when you download your whole playlist, add a few songs to it, the script will not redownload your whole playlist again.\nUsage Because this script was not designed with the UNIX philosophy in mind and more \u0026ldquo;user friendly,\u0026rdquo; there are no supported arguments. I may add them in the future. I will run through a basic example of how to use it, although the prompts should make it clear already.\n# copy the code or clone the repo chmod +x ytpl-update ./ytpl-update # run the script # ytpl-update will check if you have the latest version of yt-dlp installed and attempt to update if there is. Will also attempt to install if not already installed Which directory would you like to download to (Ex. ~/Music/example)? # Enter in the folder you want to download to ~/Music/all-my-songs Insert playlist URL you would like to download/update # Do not add quotes, just the URL will work %(title)s.%(ext)s\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBVTuiShXIE7sDtTKaW4CygVLUEv7zNv2 Downloading music from remote, please make sure test is the correct directory Continue? [y/n]: # will only take \u0026#34;y\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; as input. \u0026#34;y\u0026#34; is yes and \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; is no y # Downloading will start now, wait until the download process is finished and you are gold Syncthing How will I get all this music from my Linux laptop to my phone? How will the files be automatically synced together when I add or delete files? Syncthing. The answer is always syncthing.\nInstallation For Windows: https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html For Linux: https://apt.syncthing.net/ (unfortunately I can only find installation for apt, arch, and nix. Fedora users you are alone, sorry) For android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid Sorry no iOS, not really sorry. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be using Apple products anyways\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of linking your devices together to recognize each other and share the device over. This process is simple.\nConnect Your Devices On Linux Once installed from Ubuntu or Debian, the daemon should be already created.\nsystemctl --user enable --now syncthing.service This will enable sycnthing at startup and you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8384 to access the syncthing webUI\nOn Windows I haven\u0026rsquo;t used syncthing on Windows, but you can check this video.\nOn Android The service should be automatically started once you access the app and check the start conditions\nIn the webUI Video form\nNow that your services are setup, you want to link them. Head to http://127.0.0.1:8384. On your laptop or computer, add a new folder to share under \u0026ldquo;Folders\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;+ Add Folder\u0026rdquo;. You can label the folder anything you want, I named it \u0026ldquo;All Songs.\u0026rdquo; The folder ID can also be modified, just make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t use special characters or spaces. Something like \u0026ldquo;all-songs\u0026rdquo;. On the folder path, add in where you downloaded your music from yt-dlp, for me it was /home/hyperboly/Music/allSongs. You can check by going to where you downloaded the music and copying the output of pwd.\nAfter you add the folder, click on \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; in the top right corner of the webUI. Click on \u0026ldquo;Show ID\u0026rdquo;, and go to your syncthing app on your phone. On your phone, select devices and on the top right corner press the add new device icon. Press on the QR icon on the right of ID, and scan the QR code on your laptop. Create a name for the device and press the checkmark. This should add the device.\nNow on your laptop, there should be a dialogue box that tells you your phone wants to link up, confirm it. Click on the music folder you added and press \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Sharing\u0026rdquo; in blue text and tick the checkbox for your phone\u0026rsquo;s name that you set. Now your phone should have a notification to confirm sharing the folder, confirm it and set where you want the download to go. The syncing should start now and you are basically finished.\nWhat Now? Android has a terrible default music player, I suggest you use Vinyl from fdroid if you want a better experience.\nYou can use syncthing for things other than music, on as many devices as you want.\nAdding music to your playlist on youtube won\u0026rsquo;t automatically add it to your downloads. When you want to update your downloaded playlist, just run the same command (or my script) again and it will automatically download the new music from Youtube. When your playlist folder on your computer updates, syncthing will sync your phone up at the same time.\nDrawbacks: Syncthing will only sync when you are connected to the same network (same wifi, same router\u0026hellip;) so if your phone isn\u0026rsquo;t connected to the same wifi as your computer, your files will not sync.\n","permalink":"https://blog.hyperboly.net/posts/guides/music-consumption-the-right-way/","summary":"Learn how I get adless, downloaded, high enough quality music all for free.","title":"Music Consumption the Right Way"},{"content":"Want to build a website like this? It\u0026rsquo;s really simple and fast once you set up the infrastructure. A lot of this guide will be a repeat of how Luke Smith hosts his servers so you can read landchad for the source material. Inspired heavily from sethforprivacy. The whole website source is on github for a point of reference.\nTooling  Hugo:  A fast static-website generator that turns easily written markdown to html in miliseconds This website is all generated by hugo, using the papermod theme Learn basic markdown   rsync is the tool I use to sync up files locally to my remote webserver Git:  A definite must for this Git is a version control program that uses a central repository share, edit, and do more with your code (most common implementations of this is github, gitlab, or a selfhosted gitea instance) I use my desktop and laptop to update the website so I need to be able to have a remote repository so that I can update the website from both devices Learn git   Any VPS or spare computer:  This is for the actual webserver, choose one close to you or your audience You can host the website on any VPS like Vultr or Linode Or, host it straight from a spare computer and open port 443 on your router (less secure) A less private but easy solution can be using Cloudflare Tunnels, which is more secure than opening up a port, but less private   A domain name:  You should have your own domain name bought from one of the registrars like namecheap or Epik Makes your website more \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; and you can feel superior to github pages    Get Started with Hugo Hugo is very easy to get start with. I will assume you are on linux.\nInstallation; hugo docs # Arch-based distros sudo pacman -S hugo # Debian/Ubuntu-based distros sudo apt update ; sudo apt install hugo # Fedora/RedHat-based sudo dnf install hugo Quick Start hugo docs Change your directory into where you want the new site to be created, for me I prefer ~/Public. To create a skeleton of a new website with a config file in yaml type, use hugo new site name_of_website -f yml. The default config file is in toml but I think it\u0026rsquo;s ugly and I\u0026rsquo;m used to docker-compose.yml files. Be careful of spacing mistakes with yml.\nAnyways, let\u0026rsquo;s go into the website: cd name_of_website. If we do an ls here, or use a file manager, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the default hugo directory structure.\nname_of_website/ ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── assets/ ├── content/ ├── data/ ├── layouts/ ├── public/ ├── static/ ├── themes/ └── config.yml This is displayed with the tree command\nLet\u0026rsquo;s turn this into a git repository: git init. Now that this is a git repo, we can add in a submodule for a theme, I really like papermod, but you can choose any you want.\n Note that without a theme, hugo will not work\n # Installing papermod git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically) # Updating papermod git submodule update --remote --merge Now, add papermod into your configuration file to activate the theme. Inside config.yml, add in this line (make sure the spaces are correctly placed and not tabs):\nbaseURL: \u0026#34;https://yourdomain.com/\u0026#34; # You will buy a domain later on title: Super cool blog # Name it something cool paginate: 5 theme: PaperMod # Activating papermod as your theme, if you have more themes in the themes directory, papermod will be the one activated While we\u0026rsquo;re in the config file, let\u0026rsquo;s change some stuff for papermod. You can go and check the settings for papermod in their example config file or my config file. Most of the settings are self explanatory, but if you are confused they have documentation as well here.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s open a new terminal and cd back into the website directory: cd ~/Public/name_of_website. In here, we can start a simple webserver that should not be used for production, just for testing: hugo serve --noHTTPCache -D. --noHTTPCache just means your browser doesn\u0026rsquo;t cache the website, which would bloat up your RAM and storage. -D means that you will load drafts, which will be the default setting on your articles. Drafts will not load in your actual webserver.\nWe can start writing content for the website now, back on your first terminal: hugo new posts/first-post.md. Note that we don\u0026rsquo;t specify the whole path (content/posts/first-post.md), just path we want inside the content directory. Also note that first-post.md ends with a .md extension, which is required most content you write.\nOnce you are done writing, go to your browser and this address: http://localhost:1313. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, try http://127.0.0.1:1313. Your content should be loaded on to the front page of your website. Go ahead and edit the first-post.md file, type in whatever you want. Once the file is saved, the content you be automatically updated on your browser. This is the best feature in hugo, autoloading. It makes troubleshooting extremely easy to do, and when it errors, the error is even shown in the browser so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to read terminal if you\u0026rsquo;re scared of it.\nNice, you\u0026rsquo;ve set up a local website ready to deploy\nSetting Up Your Webserver: landchad Tutorial Get a Domain Name Domain names normally go for $10-11USD, but some websites will offer discounts such as Epik or any one of these. Pick a cool name for your website like toadnfriends.online or hyperboly.net and purchase it. I normally pick the cheapest one that looks legit to the average person. *.net is pretty recognized and doesn\u0026rsquo;t look suspicious.\nGet a Server So now you need a server to link your domain to. I will show you how to do this using a VPS\nVultr and Linode both offer $100 credits to people who use youtuber links like Luke Smith\u0026rsquo;s or LearnLinuxTV. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the links on hand so go search for them. Purchase the cheapest subscription plan they have (often times just $5USD/month, roughly 600nt) with IPv4 addresses. Select whatever location you want and choose Debian as the distribution.\nLinking Your Domain with Your Server. Now that you have everything purchased, it\u0026rsquo;s time to make the internet recognize that your domain name belongs to the IP of your server. This section is better explained by landchad, which includes a lot of visuals. Please read it.\nYou will set up an A and a AAAA record. This basically means you will link your IPv4 and IPv6 record to your server. To do this, go to your registrar and their DNS settings. Different registrars will have different buttons, please refer to their documentation.\n Namecheap Epik If you\u0026rsquo;re not using one of these, find docs on your own  The IPs of the servers should be listed on your VPS provider, check landchad for more inforamtion\nSetting Up The Actual Webserver: landchad Tutorial I will be using nginx here because I have never used apache. The nginx settings are taken from landchad and sethforprivacy.\nFirst, log into your VPS server with ssh. You want to update your server so that your servers aren\u0026rsquo;t vulnerable from old vulnerabilities: apt update ; apt upgrade ; apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx rsync. I installed all necessary packages in the code too just to save some time.\nEditing nginx Settings Create a new file and edit it in /etc/nginx/sites-available/name_of_website. In the file you should include:\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]:80 ; server_name name_of_website.com ; root /var/www/name_of_website ; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404 ; } } Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to change name_of_website.com and /var/www/name_of_website to your own domain name and website. Keep everything else the same and paste it into /etc/nginx/sites-available/name_of_website. Now you can create the directory for the website at /var/www/name_of_website, we\u0026rsquo;ll populate the directory later with rsync: mkdir /var/www/name_of_website. To enable the site so people can actually access it, do ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/name_of_website /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Reload nginx, and the website should be online. Wait a few minutes (sometimes hours) for the domain to update: systemctl reload nginx.\nPoking Holes in The VPS Firewall You\u0026rsquo;ll have to open some ports on the host in order for people to access those ports, this is done with ufw.\nufw allow 80 ufw allow 443 Getting a SSL For Your Website SSL certificates makes your website less scary for average people. Websites without an SSL certificate will display as \u0026ldquo;unsecure\u0026rdquo; in most modern browsers. To prevent this is easy. Remember when we installed nginx we also installed certbot? All we have to do is execute certbot with certbot --nginx. Go through the process, provide your email (you will be notified to renew the cert), allow your domain to have an SSL cert, and wait for certbot to finish. Now we will import the hugo site contents over to the server.\nRsync Now back on your local machine (the one with the hugo website), you should still be in the ~/Public/name_of_website directory. We will create a script that automates the process of having to rsync your files manually everytime. I like to put my scripts in ~/.local/bin, but you can put it whereever you want. I will assume the script is in ~/.local/bin/deploy-hugo. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve created your file, paste this bash script in:\n#!/bin/bash USER=root HOST=IP_of_your_server DIR=/var/www/name_of_website # the directory where your web site files should go cd ~/Public/name_of_website git pull hugo \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rsync -avz --delete public/ ${USER}@${HOST}:${DIR} # this will delete everything on the server that\u0026#39;s not in the local public folder exit 0 Edit the pasted code accordingly. Make it executable: chmod +x ~/.local/bin/deploy-hugo and try executing it: bash ~/.local/bin/deploy-hugo.\n Note that your local machine must have rsync installed as well.\n Once execution worked, go back to your remote machine and make sure that /var/www/name_of_website contains all the files such as index.html, 404.html, sitemap.xml..: ls /var/www/name_of_website. You should see your changes applied to your domain name if you navigate to https://yourdomain.com.\nCronjob For Rsync Having to execute ~/.local/bin/deploy-hugo all the time isn\u0026rsquo;t fun, which is why I set up a cronjob to execute the script every night at 20:00. All you need to do is crontab -u $USER -e and at the bottom of the file add in this line: 0 20 * * * /home/$USER/.local/bin/deploy-hugo.\nEnd You now have a fully functioning website that is encrypted and an automated website updating system.

Why would anyone use LINE to contact a doctor? Go face to face or use a Signal LINE Music: Japanese Spotify in the LINE app More corporate services  Problems with LINE Features  LINE Pay:  Apple has been infamous for locking users in their walled garden, I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to look at LINE LINE Pay is not private, should be obvious why. Using any form of centralized payment system can be tracked easily Using LINE Pay is just stupid, you have a credit card/cash for a reason, why are you so lazy?

The front page is nothing but ads, you have to tap another button to get to your chat list on mobile Oh but does LINE have a desktop version? No. At least not a real application. They could\u0026rsquo;ve at least used Electron like Discord does, but they only have an extension for Chrome. I don\u0026rsquo;t use Chrome. I don\u0026rsquo;t care if that\u0026rsquo;s my problem, an app of this size should be cross platform. They have the money and staff to do it. SO DO IT.

No one is reading news on your app, go develop a desktop version of LINE first LINE Music: LINE is really trying every avenue to steal your data and rope you into their ecosystem. It may work on the Japanese, but it won\u0026rsquo;t work on sane people. When tools like yt-dlp exists, there is no need for a streaming service that steals your data, drains your battery, and gives you the same audio quality  Message to People Who Still Willingly Use LINE Please switch to another platform.

Here, I will try to explain the structure of memory and behaviors for beginners in pwn.\nDefinition of Memory First, a basic definition of memory. Have you ever seen that long card in your computer with black squares on it? That\u0026rsquo;s memory. Most people (who watch Linus Tech Tips) know this as Random Access Memory (RAM), but at the core it is just temporary storage on your computer. RAM is immediately wiped after rebooting your computer, but is much faster than writing onto your SSD or hard drive. Functions that require temporary and fast speeds would use RAM; this includes caching websites, displaying text in a GUI, and loading chunks in games. Memory Structure I will abstract a lot of the memory structure here, so read on knowing there will be inaccuracies. Think of memory as a building, each floor is a storage space, and a building only has so many floors. Each floor and groups of floors can have a different purpose, the basement is for parking, floor 1 is for the lobby, floor 2 is for a restaurant, and the rest are residential. Now think of the floors as space in memory. There are 3 main spaces in memory, the data, stack, and heap.\nDiagram of Memory    Memory Space Description     Data Is where \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; variables are   Stack Is where \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; variables are   Heap Is where \u0026ldquo;buffers\u0026rdquo; exist    The Data Memory Space The data space will not be used in many beginner pwn questions, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever encountered it. It also means that they don\u0026rsquo;t get deleted once a function is finished, these variables persist until the program dies. This means that nothing in the data space should change while the program is running. This would include things from libraries, a variable named MAX_HEIGHT, and others like that.\nThe Stack Memory Space This is the part of memory that many beginner pwn questions will want you to attack. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever went on stackoverflow.com, the stack in memory is where that name came from. \u0026ldquo;Stack overflow\u0026rdquo; attacks are a common way that CTFs question beginners. The stack is where variable in a function exists. This would include the main function. Stacks contains variables that the programmer defines the memory to. For example, int foo = 7; is the programmer dedicating 4 bytes of memory to foo. He is dedicating 4 bytes because by default in C, an integer is 4 bytes in length. Inside the 4 bytes, it would only store \u0026ldquo;7\u0026rdquo; though.\nProbably more important than variables in the stack is the pointer and addresses in the stack. The stack pointer is not like pointers in C/C++. The stack pointer indicates where the program is while the program is running. This becomes very helpful while debugging. The Extended Instruction Pointer exists at the end of the stack execution, where it will look for the next instruction. This becomes useful when we do something called a \u0026ldquo;stack overflow,\u0026rdquo; where you overflow the whole stack and enter in the malicious instruction onto the original instruction pointer space. Later articles will further explain the stack.\nThe stack does NOT include the buffers, which is in the \u0026ldquo;heap.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Heap Memory Space The heap is, as mentioned, where the buffers live. But what are buffers? Buffers are spaces in code that the programmer dictates. How is this different from declaring a variable in the stack? Stack variables can\u0026rsquo;t be resized, but buffers can. If I create a array in C, like this: int ary[100], I am dynamically assigning 404 bytes to ary (0-100 integers, each int is 4 bytes). Confused? Me too! Stack variables have the life cycle of being declared, stored, and initialized during runtime. When the function ends, so do the variables in the stack.\nThe heap is more \u0026ldquo;floaty,\u0026rdquo; as in it exists in no particular order. Multiple buffers can live in memory without an order like stack variables do. The memory allocated is also decided by the programmer, not the compiler. Before I mentioned int takes 4 bytes of space, this is not a decision by the programmer but by the compiler. Compared to int ary[100];, the programmer specifies that he wants 404 bytes for this.\n","permalink":"https://blog.hyperboly.net/posts/notes/memory-basics/","summary":"How memory is structured and what it really is","title":"Memory Basics"},{"content":"Pwn as a CTF category has always interested me because of the low level understanding it requires to be good at it. Turns out I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at it, so here are my notes to try and organize what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned. The pico primer really helped me with this. CryptoCat\u0026rsquo;s tutorial is also great for learning.\nDefinitions: Abstraction I find that many people trying to get into computers get confused with abstraction as I did before, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to explain it in simple terms. Abstraction means to dumb down. For example, in math, many questions ask you to \u0026ldquo;simplify an expression\u0026rdquo; when you simplify an expression, you are abstracting the original expression. Or, if I have a chunk of code in a program that takes in user input, it would be stupid to always repeat that code on and on. Which is why we have functions, so we can name it \u0026ldquo;take_input\u0026rdquo; and abstract away the code in the function. This is most evident in programming languages, as you\u0026rsquo;ll read later, programming languages just abstract assembly; assembly just abstracts binary.\nDisassembling Disassembling is basically the process of turning some binary into assembly language. Humans aren\u0026rsquo;t able to read binary as well as they can assembly. To read binary, you would have to separate them into different chunks, try to decode what the binary\u0026rsquo;s value is, and try to translate that into what the machine is doing. Assembly makes this process 10% easier by telling you exactly what the computer is doing. This is still really hard to read because it provides you with extremely LOW LOW levels of abstraction in memory. Things like Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) that takes a long time to fully grasp the concept.\nTooling: What you\u0026rsquo;ll notice with pwn is that there is a million different tools that achieve the same thing, I\u0026rsquo;ll start with debugging:\nGNU Debugger (GDB) GDB is an amazing debugger for pwn, it can do everything it needs to well. GDB takes in a binary and provides a disassembler, gives you the location of different pointers, functions\u0026hellip; The problem is that the syntax will take forever to learn.\nGEF GEF is essentially a wrapper for GDB. This means that it simplifies GDB\u0026rsquo;s syntax so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to type long lines just to achieve one thing. I learned GEF when watching a video on pwnable.tw\u0026rsquo;s start, which I haven\u0026rsquo;t finished because I don\u0026rsquo;t understand it at all.\npwndbg pwndbg is another wrapper for GDB (see a pattern here?). It is written in python and I think further simplifies GDB\u0026rsquo;s syntax (compared to GEF). It is a little easier to learn and the current one I\u0026rsquo;m learning.\nGhidra Ghidra is a tool developed by the NSA for disassembling and turning binaries into C. It is written in Java so I only run it in a VM, because any Java software is bloat for your system. The tool gives you a UI unlike the other 3 tools above, disassembles the code like with GDB, and tries to recreate the binary in C. This can give you a lot more insight into what the code is doing, which helps a lot in CTFs.\npwn pwn is a pretty sweet python library that helps a LOT in solving CTFs and automating your solutions. The problem is that I\u0026rsquo;m a terrible programmer and can only program in BASH. It includes stuff like remote which allows you to attack remote services with python, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool.\n","permalink":"https://blog.hyperboly.net/posts/notes/starting-pwn/","summary":"An introduction to the pwn (binary exploit) category for CTFs","title":"Starting Pwn"},{"content":"A Comprehensive Guide on GPU Passthroughs in Proxmox For the RX6600XT GPU Some Prerequisites and Notes This method of passing through my GPU works for:\n Kernel: 5.15.30 Proxmox Version 7.2 TUF Gaming X570 Plus Motherboard Dual Radeon RX6600XT Asus GPU Ryzen 7 5800X CPU  In the BIOs for your host computer (where Proxmox is installed) settings, these options should be modified:\n Secure boot: Off CPU Settings:  SUM: On PSS: On   PCI Subsystem Settings:  Above 4G Encoding: On SR-IOV Support: On   AMD CBS:  IOMMU: On    The Passthrough Process This is the part of the process where everything is either done in an ssh session, on the host computer\u0026rsquo;s shell, or the webGUI for proxmox.\nUpdate Proxmox First make sure your Proxmox is updated with the correct repos. You can follow the Proxmox docs for this.\nNext, you want to get your favorite text editor (Nano is preinstalled but I will use vim)\n # apt-get install vim\n GRUB/Systemd Edits For Systemd, every step will be the same, the only difference is you will edit /etc/kernel/cmdline for the GRUB flags, all flags will be the same.\n# vim /etc/default/grub to get edit a file. I assume you have background knowledge already in a terminal, if not, refer to vim(1) or nano(1).\nFind the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \u0026quot;quiet\u0026quot; and add these flags within the quotation marks:\n iommu=pt amd_iommu=on video=efifb:off video=vesafb:off textonly video=simplefb:off nofb\n Write quit.\n update-grub update-grub works even if you are on systemd boot.\n After this, reboot.\nMessing With Drivers Check if you did everything correctly with\n dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU\n This should output something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;IOMMU enabled\u0026rdquo; or something like it.\nYou can also check with\n cat /proc/cmdline\n This should output what you modified in GRUB or systemd boot.\nNow you want to edit the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file in order to blacklist your host machine from using your GPU so that the GPU isn\u0026rsquo;t split between your host and VM (splitting the processes will break it). Add these lines:\n blacklist nvidia\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist radeon\n Now edit the /etc/modules file and add:\n vfio\nvfio_iommu_type1\nvfio_pci\nvfio_virqfd\n Now you update initramfs and reboot with:\n update-initramfs -u\nreboot\n Isolating Your GPU Run lspci -nnk and find your GPU. My RX6600XT GPU shows up as:\n 0a:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Navi 23 [1002:73ff] (rev c1)\n Below it should be a audio controller. Mine looks like:\n 0a:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Device [1002:ab28]\n Note the 0a:00 and [1002:XXXX], these will be important soon.\nNow you will edit /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf and add:\n options vfio-pci ids=XXXX:XXXX,XXXX:XXXX disable-vga=1\n Where XXXX:XXXX are substituted by the numbers in the [] before. For example, for me it would look like:\n options vfio-pci ids=1002:73ff,1002:ab28 disable_vga=1\n Now reboot again just in case.\nTo check if you are using the correct kernel module for your GPU, do lspci -v and see if your GPU\u0026rsquo;s kernel in use is vfio-pci or the line is just not there. If either is true, you\u0026rsquo;re halfway there.\nBlack Magic Section Welcome to Black Magic, where nothing in the section makes sense to me.\nRun cat /proc/iomem and under your GPU bus (0X:00, or for me it\u0026rsquo;s 0a:00), there might be a BOOTFB. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see BOOTFB, skip this section. If you do, follow the next steps carefully.\n cd /root\ntouch gpufix.sh\nvim gpufix.sh\n Inside this file, you will add these lines:\n #!/bin/bash\necho 1 \u0026gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:0X:00.0/remove\necho 1 \u0026gt; /sys/bus/pci/rescan\n Write and quit. Run chmod +x gpufix.sh. Lastly, add to the cron entry.\n crontab -e\n@reboot /root/gpufix.sh at the end of the file.\n Reboot.\nVM Creation If the settings are not mentioned in this segment, leave them as default. Go into the web GUI for Proxmox and click on create VM. I used a Windows 11 VM with VirtIO drivers (get the ISOs from Windows officially and Redhat unofficially).\nThe following segment are settings needed for this to work:\n System Settings:  q35 OVMF EFI disk and TPM (note that EFI and TPM must be stored on the same disk)   Disk Settings:  SCSI At least 50GB for Windows bloat   CPU:  As much as you can give it, for example 6 cores.   RAM:  As much as you can give it, for example 8GiB.   Networking:  Virt-IO (paravirtualized)   Do not start after creation.  After you have created the VM, go into the hardware settings and add an ISO image. This ISO image would be the Virt-IO drivers that you downloaded before. In the options tab in the VM under hardware check the Boot Order. The Boot Order should be your 50GB (or what you set it) hard disk first, your Windows ISO (in ide), net0, and lastly the Virt-IO drivers (ide).\nWindows 11 Installation First, be prepared for the pain and suffering Windows 11 installation can be. Linux is years ahead with the installation with the live USB thing, why can\u0026rsquo;t Microsoft catch up? Anyways, you\u0026rsquo;ll apply the virt-IO drivers here.\n Click on install Windows and custom install. You must select Windows 11 pro. This will prompt you into a window where you can select Load Drivers. In the file explorer, click on your C: or whatever drive that has the virt-IO drivers. Drop down the amd64 folder and choose the w11 folder. Press OK and Next. Load another driver called the NetKVM driver, choose NetKVM\u0026gt;w11\u0026gt;amd64. Go through the rest of the install process reading what it prompts you to do. CAREFULLY READ THESE BECAUSE YOU CAN OPT OUT OF SPYWARE\u0026hellip; probably. After everything\u0026rsquo;s settled and you can log into Windows, go to file explorer and select the virt-IO drive once more. Click on virtio-win-gt-x64 and execute it. Shutdown the VM and go back to the Proxmox web GUI. Select hardware again and add a PCI device. Look for your 0X:00.0 vendor tag and select it. Tick every box except for primary GPU (PCI-express, ROM-Bar, All Functions). Start your VM up again. Go into the browser and look for AMD GPU drivers, download it and install it. While installing, you might notice your host machine\u0026rsquo;s monitor start displaying Windows but your mouse and keyboard may not be able to do anything. Reboot and follow the next section. Finally, tick the primary GPU option in your GPU options.  Finishing Touches By now, you are already set to go, except that you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything with your keyboard and mouse. To fix this, shutdown the VM once more and go to hardware settings in the Proxmox web GUI. Add USB devices and passthrough every port with your keyboard, mouse, whatever else you want. Now, you are truly done. Start up your VM and enjoy being exploited by Windows.\nExternal Links If you continue to struggle with GPU passthrough, here are all the articles I went through to find my solution.\n  Documentation  Proxmox Docs Arch Wiki Debian Docs    Unofficial Guides  Reddit Ultimate Guide (outdated) Reddit 2 Min Guide (outdated) Tutorial From Proxmox Forums RX6600XT Specific (didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me) Dumping V-BIOs Blog    Forums  Black Magic Radeon RX6600 Specific Post on Reddit Dumping V-BIOs Thread    Support This Guide If you have any other GPU\u0026rsquo;s that you got working whether absurdly like me or even normally, consider making a pull request for it or submitting an issue on the github!\n","permalink":"https://blog.hyperboly.net/posts/guides/gpupassthroughamd6600/","summary":"A Comprehensive Guide on GPU Passthroughs in Proxmox for the RX6600XT GPU","title":"GPU passthrough for RX6600XT"}]
