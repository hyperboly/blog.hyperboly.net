      <description>For the non-Asians, LINE is the Japanese version of WeChat or WhatsApp. So yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s Japanese spyware that has spread to the majority of East Asia.
LINE Features  LINE Pay: Like Apple Pay but with LINE Instant messaging: This was the original purpose of the app LINE News: Like Google News but in the LINE app LINE Doctor: Why? Why would anyone use LINE to contact a doctor? Go face to face or use a Signal LINE Music: Japanese Spotify in the LINE app More corporate services  Problems with LINE Features  LINE Pay:  Apple has been infamous for locking users in their walled garden, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at LINE LINE Pay is not private, should be obvious why.</description>

      <description>Memory is essential to understand for pwning in CTFs. Here, I will try to explain the structure of memory and behaviors for beginners in pwn.
Definition of Memory First, a basic definition of memory. Have you ever seen that long card in your computer with black squares on it? That&amp;rsquo;s memory. Most people (who watch Linus Tech Tips) know this as Random Access Memory (RAM), but at the core it is just temporary storage on your computer.</description>

      <title>Starting Pwn</title>

      <description>Pwn as a CTF category has always interested me because of the low level understanding it requires to be good at it. Turns out I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at it, so here are my notes to try and organize what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. The pico primer really helped me with this. CryptoCat&amp;rsquo;s tutorial is also great for learning.
Definitions: Abstraction I find that many people trying to get into computers get confused with abstraction as I did before, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain it in simple terms.</description>

      <description>This blog is just for me to rant and take notes for random stuff I&amp;rsquo;m doing. Currently, I play CTFs, selfhost servers, and play table tennis. This blog itself is selfhosted with hugo. An unfiltered look into the demented mind of a nerd.
DISCLAIMER: Anything I write as fact should not be taken as fact, it is just the understanding of low GPA highschool student. For example, &amp;ldquo;The Linux kernel has a scheduler for CPU tasks.</description>

      <description>A Comprehensive Guide on GPU Passthroughs in Proxmox Some Prerequisites and Notes This method of passing through my GPU works for:
 Kernel: 5.15.30 Proxmox Version 7.2 TUF Gaming X570 Plus Motherboard Dual Radeon RX6600XT Asus GPU Ryzen 7 5800X CPU  In the BIOs for your host computer (where Proxmox is installed) settings, these options should be modified:
 Secure boot: Off CPU Settings:  SUM: On PSS: On   PCI Subsystem Settings:  Above 4G Encoding: On SR-IOV Support: On   AMD CBS:  IOMMU: On    The Passthrough Process This is the part of the process where everything is either done in an ssh session, on the host computer&amp;rsquo;s shell, or the webGUI for proxmox.</description>
